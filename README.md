# Stock_Analyzer_API

A client from CME Group has requested the development of new APIs designed
for the assessment of the historical performance of specific stocks over a defined
period, which should not exceed six months. The project entails the following
primary use cases:

1. **User Authentication Module:**
Implement a user sign-up and sign-in system to ensure secure access to the
platform.
2. **Stock Performance Data Management:**
Develop API to gather daily performance data for specified stocks.
Calculate the average performance over a user-defined time frame.
3. **Stock Performance Comparison:**
Create an API to enable users to compare the daily performance of two distinct
stocks over a specified period.
As a developer, your responsibilities include conducting a comprehensive analysis
of the client's requirements and formulating a set of APIs to address these needs.
This includes producing both high-level and low-level designs and designing the
necessary database structure. The project will also involve the actual
implementation of these components.

**Key Considerations:**
• Populate static stock values for testing purposes. Utilize an in-memory
database for efficient data storage, load all essential data during application
startup.
• Implement the project as a Maven-based Spring Boot application.
• Consider all potential edge cases to ensure robust functionality.
• Thorough exception handling and error management.
• Proper logging mechanism.
